# Data Transformation using Python (Jupyter Notebook)

## Project Description
This repository contains a data transformation project implemented in a Jupyter Notebook. The notebook performs data cleaning, classification, and analysis of global sales averages using Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy. It documents the process step-by-step and displays the output directly within the notebook.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab to run the `.ipynb` file.
- Required Python libraries:
  - [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
  - [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)

### Installing
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bhavika-L/data-Readme-transformation-python.git
### Navigate into the project directory:
   cd data-Readme-transformation-python

### Install the required packages
pip install pandas numpy jupyter

### Running the Notebook 
Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
jupyter notebook

### Open the Notebook
In the Jupyter interface, locate and open the Assignment 1 Final.ipynb file.

### Execute the Notebook
Run the notebook cells sequentially to see the data transformation process and the resulting outputs.

### Code Overview
The Jupyter Notebook (Assignment 1 Final.ipynb) includes:

Data Import and Cleaning: Loading the dataset and handling missing data.
Data Classification: Separating records into 'pre-2005' and 'post-2005' groups.
Analysis: Calculating and comparing global sales averages.
Output Display: Printing results and conclusions directly within the notebook.

## Deployment
This project is intended for local execution and demonstration purposes using Jupyter Notebook. No additional deployment steps are required.
